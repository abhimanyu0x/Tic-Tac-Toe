# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe project repository. This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, designed to be a fun and educational coding exercise. The primary objective of this project is to showcase my ability to create a functional game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to provide a reference point for future projects.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two players to play against each other on the same device.
- **Game Board Display**: A clear and intuitive representation of the game board.
- **Win Detection**: Automatically detects when a player has won or if the game has resulted in a draw.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that player inputs are valid and handles invalid moves gracefully.
- **Restart Option**: Provides an option to restart the game after a win, loss, or draw.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the game board and user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abhimanyu0x/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Run**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. **Gameplay**:
   - The game will prompt each player to click on a cell in the game board to place their mark (X or O).
   - Players take turns to place their marks.
   - The game board is updated after each move, and the game continues until there is a win or a draw.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game board and user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I have gained experience in:

- **Web Development**: Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional web application.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Understanding the logic required to create a turn-based game.
- **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions and updating the game state accordingly.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Dynamically updating the web page content based on user actions.

## Future Improvements

- **AI Opponent**: Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance the user interface to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Animations**: Add animations to make the game more visually appealing.
